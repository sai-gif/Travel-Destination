        <h1>Best travel destination in the USA</h1>

    <p>From coastlines to big cities, the United States is made up of so many diverse destinations that
     it's hard to decide which places deserve the distinction of the best in America. That's why U.S.
     News considered a variety of factors, such as attractions, accommodations 
    and dining options, as well as votes from thousands of travelers, to determine the best places
     to visit in the USA.</p>

                <h3>Glacier National Park, Montana</h3>
                <p>
                    Glaciers are the main draw of this Montana national park, but its more than 700 lakes, 
                    two mountain ranges and multiple waterfalls are equally impressive. Hiking is the most popular
                    pastime for visitors thanks to the park's mix of easy trails like Rocky Point and challenging
                    routes, such as Grinnell Glacier and the Highline Trail. But you should also allot time for
                    driving the spectacular Going-to-the-Sun Road, which typically opens late June through October
                    . Additionally, the area is a prime spot for kayaking, canoeing and fishing in summer, and cross-country
                    skiing and snowshoeing in winter. Plus, wild animals 
                    like moose, bears and elk are frequently spotted here

                <h3>Maui, Hawaii</h3>
                <p>
                    With idyllic beaches and verdant parks, Maui offers ample opportunities to relax. Here, you can admire the stunning scenery as you cruise along the Road to Hana, fly above the Hawaiian island on a helicopter tour or lounge across the black sands of Wai'anapanapa State Park. If you'd rather cool off than sunbathe, sign up for a snorkeling tour. And for an unforgettable experience, make a reservation to see the sunrise at Haleakala National Park, home to Maui's highest peak. Sampling Maui's seafood is also a must, but don't overlook other island delicacies like haupia, a creamy coconut custard.

                <h3>Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona</h3>
                <p>
                    To experience some of the most inspiring views America has to offer, plan a trip to Grand Canyon National Park. A bucket-list item for many travelers, this Arizona park is a superb spot to hike, offering scenic paths like the Bright Angel and North Kaibab trails. The Colorado River weaves its way through the 277-mile-long canyon, which also makes it a top destination for whitewater rafting. But for a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience, travelers can view this impressive natural wonder on a helicopter tour. Regardless of how you choose to spend your time in the Grand Canyon, you're sure to feel small against its towering rock formations and expansive vistas.
